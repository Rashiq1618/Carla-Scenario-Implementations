This project demonstrates a small platoon of autonomous vehicles in the CARLA simulator. The setup includes a leader vehicle on autopilot and multiple follower vehicles that maintain safe distances using PID control. Vehicle states, including speed and distance to the vehicle in front, are communicated to an external controller via UDP, which sends back target speeds for the followers.
